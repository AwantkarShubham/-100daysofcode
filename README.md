# -100daysofcode

taking 100daysofcode challenge, and will try to learn different technologies in the next 100 days.
The main focus of this challenge for me will web development-related technologies such as Html, CSS, Javascript(basic), python Django framework, and MongoDB.
As a student, it is important to learn new technology and explore them with your creative ideas,
but sometimes you may get confused about where to start? how to start? Which technologies should I learn? how to explore your interest?
by taking this challenge I think all the answers to these questions will get.
